                I enjoyed how the focus this week was rendering the basics. I believe that it’s always good to revisit and polish the basics of any skill you learned whether it’s something you’ve mastered or not.  My focus this week was just polishing my general code, especially CSS. I’m still gaining confidence with JavaScript, there are still things I struggle to implement which leads to me leaving out that section of the code hindering my project idea and so forth.
                I did want to reflect on my work so far in this blog post, I think it’s a good idea to address my progress thus far. My project in terms of the technical side is a slow process, I tend to have a really big idea which sounds good and seems doable but once it’s time to implement it I would struggle and end up changing my idea because I couldn’t get it to work for my first idea. It did lead to me changing my idea many times which in turn slowed down my progress because I always found myself back to square one. This has been the pattern from the start of the project. I do think that I will eventually stick to one concept and try my best to meet the brief and also go back to specifics that I struggle with and polish those specifics that are hindering my growth as a web developer.
