        <article>
            <p>
                I enjoyed the content shared for this week. The Dean article was the very first article I engaged with when trying to figure out internet art, so seeing it in this week’s content provided more relief because it made me feel confident in the extra research and article I’ve engaged with ( in other words it made me feel like I was finding the right article and I’m on the right track). Even though I engaged with the Dean article before this week I still felt like it didn’t really explain what internet art was- I was still feeling very lost and still asking myself more questions rather than finding answers. I engaged with it again, I still feel the same.
 Nothing has really changed but I do think that my view on internet art has changed. How I understand internet art is simply expressing yourself on the web- not sure if I’m going about, it the right way but from most of the work, I’ve engaged with I’ve noticed that it’s people expressing their thoughts and interests and I’m overthinking this whole internet art thing.
But the follow-up question I still keep asking myself is what makes it different from simply writing a story/journal or painting something? But my answer would be because it’s on the internet but my follow-up question to this answer would be “Images are on the internet and images are considered as art so would web images be considered internet art?” I don’t think I have a solid answer to my own question just yet.
When engaging with reading that spoke to how Internet Artworks impact ‘traditional’ art it took me back to a reading we did last year: The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin. In this day we are shifting from ‘traditional’ art to art being on digital spaces which are affecting museums and the artwork itself. Benjamin speaks on aura essentially speaking to the arts’ presence in time and space.
With regard to the technical aspect of this week, I managed to follow the video better than in previous weeks. I appreciate how the concept was broken down, it helped me understand the concept better. I paced myself well and took my time. It all comes down to practising what I learned in order to fully grasp it and execute it.
